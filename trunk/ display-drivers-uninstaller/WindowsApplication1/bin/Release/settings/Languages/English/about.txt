Driver Uninstaller (DDU) / Cleaner made for Display Drivers.(NVIDIA/AMD)

What it does is removing the Display driver from device manager and removing the current and 
all precedent driver from the Windows Driver store along with removing services from NVIDIA/AMD.

The current effect after you use this tool will be similar as if Windows was in a "Fresh Install" state.

This tool act similar to what Driver sweeper do + the extra mentioned above.

If you have problem installing older driver or newer one, give it a try as there are some reports that it fix 
those problems.

RECOMMENDED USAGE :

- I personally recommend that you disconnect the internet while doing this because sometimes after the 
uninstall, windows update may be re-installing a driver on its own without authorization...

-The tool can be used in Normal mode but for absolute stability when using DDU, Safemode is 
always the best.

- We would like to gather feedback from you guys. Tell us if it was success or not. Make a 
backup or a system restore (but it should normally be pretty safe).

-If you have or had a driver problem, and this tool helped you with some issues your are 
currently experiencing, please share your result.

Keep in mind that NVIDIA/AMD did not have anything to do with this, We do not work at or for NVIDIA/AMD 
and they should not be held responsible for any damage or errors caused to your system.
