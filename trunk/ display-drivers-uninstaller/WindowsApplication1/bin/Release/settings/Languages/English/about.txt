 Driver Uninstaller (DDU) / Cleaner made for Display Drivers.(NVIDIA/AMD)

What it does is remove the display/GPU driver from device manager and remove the current and 
all precedent driver from the Windows Driver store along with removing services from NVIDIA/AMD.

The current effect after you use this tool will be similar to if Windows was in a "Fresh Install" state.

This tool acts much like "Driver Sweeper", and has all the extra mentioned above.

If you have any problems installing an older driver or a newer one, give it a try as there are some reports that it fix 
those problems.

RECOMMENDED USAGE :

-The tool can be used in Normal mode but for absolute stability when using DDU, Safe Mode is 
always the best.

- We would like to gather feedback from everyone, tell us if it was success or not. Make a 
backup or a system restore (but it should normally be pretty safe).

-If you have or had a driver problem, and this tool helped you with some issues you were or are
currently experiencing, please share your result.

Keep in mind that NVIDIA , AMD or Microsoft cannot be held responsible for any damages of any sort 
to you or your computer and in no way affiliates of DDU or it's creators.
